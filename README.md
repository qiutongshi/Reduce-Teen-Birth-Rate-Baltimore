# Reduce-TeenBirthRate-Baltimore-
## Introduction
Teen pregnancies carry extra risks to both the mother and the baby. Baltimore city has a teen birth rate twice as high as the state of Maryland and three times as high as the national average. This project uses linear regression and cluster analysis to explore the racial and economical factors contributing to teen birth rate in Baltimore, hopefully giving an insight into the services and initiatives to reduce the rate.  

While cluster analysis groups teenage birth rate with its distinct corresponding minority residence rate, linear regression also shows that racial factors can contribute greatly to teenage birth rate. After the data analysis, we believe that current initiatives that include education, prevention and follow-up need to be more targeted to counties where Hispanic, AIAN and NHOPI residence rate is higher. 	

Further studies on how to improve the education, prevention and follow-up cautions on teenage pregnancy are needed to better solve the identified problem at several measures such as campaigns and community resources can be more precisely targeted at high-risk groups.

## Background
According to the [Baltimore City Health Department](https://health.baltimorecity.gov/node/170.), Baltimore City has an average teen birth rate of 43.4 out of 1,000 teenage females (ages 15-19). This rate is about twice as high as the national average (26.5 out of 1,000). Although this rate has been steadily declining over the past decade, there is more that can and should be done.

Teen birth is a serious social and economic problem. [According to one study](https://www.childtrends.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/child_trends-2010_01_22_FS_diplomaattainment.pdf.), teen pregnancies and births are a significant contributor to dropping out of school. Females who dropout of school face social stigma, fewer job opportunities, lower salaries, and a [higher probability of criminal activity](https://www.doe.mass.edu/dropout/overview.html?section=consequences#:~:text=Dropping%20out%20of%20school%20has,with%20the%20criminal%20justice%20system.). There is also a social ripple effect. Like their mothers, [children of teen births](http://webarchive.urban.org/publications/901199.html#:~:text=Teenage%20motherhood%20costs%20taxpayers%20about,teenage%20parents%20and%20their%20children.) are more likely to achieve lower education, be incarcerated, experience teen pregnancy, and have difficulty finding employment. Due to the socioeconomic status of their teen mother, they are also more likely to have health problems.

This is an urgent problem that needs to be addressed as soon as possible because of the significant short- and long-term consequences. If teen pregnancy is not addressed, our society could be looking at generations of families impacted by the aforementioned social repercussions. These effects impact teen families and the larger communityâ€™s functionality, efficiency, and productivity.



### Racial factors in teen birth
[Several articles and studies](https://www.npr.org/2014/04/14/302906835/why-do-more-latina-teens-get-pregnant.) found that Latinas have one of the highest teen pregnancy rates in the United States. 
<img width="688" alt="Screen Shot 2020-12-17 at 17 32 26" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70663111/102551638-d602b480-408d-11eb-8f5d-7c4d9df2c944.png">  

The bar chart shown above is from [data analysis](https://www.cdc.gov/teenpregnancy/about/index.htm#:~:text=In%202017%2C%20the%20birth%20rates,highest%20among%20all%20race%2Fethnicities.) conducted by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC, Figure 1). Due to their high teen pregnancy rates, Hispanic females also have one of the highest teen birth rates in the United States. Black, American Indian/Alaska Native (AIAN), and Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander (NHOPI) also have very high teen birth rates that exceed the rate of all races and origins. [Another study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23450881/.) found that socioeconomic conditions, such as living under the poverty line, could contribute to high teen birth rates. 

Baltimore City has more people living under the poverty line [(21.8%)](https://datausa.io/profile/geo/baltimore-city-md#:~:text=21.8%25%20of%20the%20population%20for,and%20then%20Females%2055%20%2D%2064.) than the national average (13.1%), with the largest demographic group living in poverty being females. Baltimore City is also [largely made up of racial minorities](https://datausa.io/profile/geo/baltimore-md/#:~:text=The%205%20largest%20ethnic%20groups,%2DHispanic.). Since [prior research](https://urbanhealth.jhu.edu/_archive/2019/_downloads/reducing_teen_births_execsumm.pdf.) on teen birth rates was generally focused on analyzing general or African American populations, we wanted to focus our data analysis on low income, Hispanic, AIAN, and NHOPI populations to see if the aforementioned national trends persist in Baltimore City. We wanted to analyze if racial demographics and socioeconomic status could contribute to the teen birth rate in Baltimore City to answer our business question: how can the Baltimore City Health Department reduce teen birth rates in Baltimore City?

### Current Initiatives  
- Teen Pregnancy Prevention Initiative (TPPI)
As part of the [B'more for Healthy Babies programs](https://www.healthybabiesbaltimore.com.), Baltimore City has instituted the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Initiative (TPPI) to reduce teen births. TPPI has four key strategies: a Teen Pregnancy Prevention Task Force, Provider Engagement and Outreach, Youth Advisory Council, and a Social Marketing Campaign. 

- Healthy Teens & Young Adults (HTYA)  
The Healthy Teens and Young Adults' (HTYA) mission is to reduce unintended pregnancies and to improve pregnancy outcomes by providing reproductive health services to young women and men 10 - 24 years of age.  Services also available include: Contraception (birth control) including IUDs and subdermal implant (Nexplanon). This program serves as an indirect sub program to reduce teenage birth rate.


## Business Question
How to decrease teen birth rate in Baltimore more efficiently? 

## Data Question
What are the factors impacting teen birth rate in Baltimore, and how do they weight differently? Waht are the features of different representitive groups in Baltimore?

## Data Metrics
- Teen birth rate  
- Home below poverty line rate
  - Can be a general indicator of family income level, but not a precise one because it does not reflect range, standard deviation etc.
- Hispanic residence rate
  - The total number of persons that identify their ethnicity as being Hispanic or Latino out of the total number of persons living in an area. 
- NHOPI & AIAN residence rate
  - The total number of persons that identify themselves as being of either American Indian, Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, or some other race (non-Hispanic) out of the total number of persons living in an area.

## Data Analysis
### Initial Findings  
<img width="673" alt="Screen Shot 2020-12-17 at 17 53 37" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70663111/102553410-cb95ea00-4090-11eb-8cc3-276127f86eb3.png">   

The figure above reinforces our background research for our problem statement. In the past four years, teen birth rate has been declining in every region of Baltimore City. Notably, the Northwest region of Baltimore City experienced a -83.5% decline in teen birth rates over 2015-2018. However, this bar chart also shows the dichotomy of percent change between the regions. Not every region was as successful as the Northwest region in reducing teen birth rate. For example, the Southeast region experienced the least percent change decline in those years. Although teen birth rates have been declining due to the initiatives in place, there is room for improvement.


### Linear Regression
<img width="564" alt="Screen Shot 2020-12-17 at 17 54 25" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70663111/102553481-e7998b80-4090-11eb-88b1-1004f9b96813.png">   

The equation indicated by the linear regression analysis summary is: 
<img width="564" alt="Screen Shot 2020-12-17 at 17 55 23" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70663111/102553561-0ac43b00-4091-11eb-8da3-1ca54241f4c5.png">

This suggests that as the percentage of families living under the poverty line, percentage of AIAN or NHOPI populations, and percentage of Hispanic population increase, so does teen birth rate. In the figure above, you can easily see that all three factors are positively correlated with teen birth rate (Figure 4). The percentage of Hispanic population has an especially high correlation coefficient, which indicates that it is doing a better job of explaining the outcome and has a greater effect on teen birth rate compared to the other two factors.

<img width="675" alt="Screen Shot 2020-12-17 at 17 55 59" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70663111/102553613-1fa0ce80-4091-11eb-8331-0ef5aa03592d.png">

The R-squared value is 0.4854415, which means that about 48.5% of the data can be predicted with the model. The regression model also had a low F-significance value of 1.7994E-07, which indicates that these factors matter for the end model. All factors also have p-values of less than 0.05, which means that they are significant in predicting the outcome (Table 1).


### Cluster Analysis
<img width="632" alt="Screen Shot 2020-12-17 at 17 56 48" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70663111/102553681-3d6e3380-4091-11eb-8446-a6fd2551d415.png">

This suggests that each of the three different cluster groups anchored as 1, 2, and 3 is represented by Greenmount East, Northwood, Brooklyn/Curtis Bay/ Hawkins. Group 1 has a slightly lower than average teen birth rate, a much higher than average home below poverty line rate, a much lower percent of Hispanic or H&AIAN&NHOPI  minority residence rate. Group 2 has an extremely lower than average teen birth rate, an extremely less than average home below poverty line rate, a less than average residence of Hispanic or Asian or H&AIAN&NHOPI minority. Group 3 has an extremely high teen birth rate, a high less than average home below poverty line rate, and a lot more residents of Hispanic and H&AIAN&NHOPI  minorities.
