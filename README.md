# Reduce-TeenBirthRate-Baltimore-
## Introduction
Teen pregnancies carry extra risks to both the mother and the baby. Baltimore city has a teen birth rate twice as high as the state of Maryland and three times as high as the national average. This project uses linear regression and cluster analysis to explore the racial and economical factors contributing to teen birth rate in Baltimore, hopefully giving an insight into the services and initiatives to reduce the rate.  

While cluster analysis groups teenage birth rate with its distinct corresponding minority residence rate, linear regression also shows that racial factors can contribute greatly to teenage birth rate. After the data analysis, we believe that current initiatives that include education, prevention and follow-up need to be more targeted to counties where Hispanic, AIAN and NHOPI residence rate is higher. 	

Further studies on how to improve the education, prevention and follow-up cautions on teenage pregnancy are needed to better solve the identified problem at several measures such as campaigns and community resources can be more precisely targeted at high-risk groups.

## Background
According to the [Baltimore City Health Department](https://health.baltimorecity.gov/node/170.), Baltimore City has an average teen birth rate of 43.4 out of 1,000 teenage females (ages 15-19). This rate is about twice as high as the national average (26.5 out of 1,000). Although this rate has been steadily declining over the past decade, there is more that can and should be done.

Teen birth is a serious social and economic problem. [According to one study](https://www.childtrends.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/child_trends-2010_01_22_FS_diplomaattainment.pdf.), teen pregnancies and births are a significant contributor to dropping out of school. Females who dropout of school face social stigma, fewer job opportunities, lower salaries, and a [higher probability of criminal activity](https://www.doe.mass.edu/dropout/overview.html?section=consequences#:~:text=Dropping%20out%20of%20school%20has,with%20the%20criminal%20justice%20system.). There is also a social ripple effect. Like their mothers, [children of teen births](http://webarchive.urban.org/publications/901199.html#:~:text=Teenage%20motherhood%20costs%20taxpayers%20about,teenage%20parents%20and%20their%20children.) are more likely to achieve lower education, be incarcerated, experience teen pregnancy, and have difficulty finding employment. Due to the socioeconomic status of their teen mother, they are also more likely to have health problems.

This is an urgent problem that needs to be addressed as soon as possible because of the significant short- and long-term consequences. If teen pregnancy is not addressed, our society could be looking at generations of families impacted by the aforementioned social repercussions. These effects impact teen families and the larger communityâ€™s functionality, efficiency, and productivity.



### Racial factors in teen birth
[Several articles and studies](https://www.npr.org/2014/04/14/302906835/why-do-more-latina-teens-get-pregnant.) found that Latinas have one of the highest teen pregnancy rates in the United States.

## Business Question
How do educational characteristics differ by race in the U.S.? How can these differences inform potential policy action regarding the US educational system? 

## Data Question
What are the similarities and differences between racial disparities in education between Florida, California, Pennsylvania, and Illinois, and what are the possible reasons behind these disparities? 

## Data Metrics
- Academic performance by race: 
  - Average test scores: Average test scores are influenced by opportunities to learn at home, in the neighborhood, during child-care, at preschool and after-school programs, from classmates and friends, and at -most obviously- school.
    - SAT and AP test scores
  - Chronic Absenteeism: Students who are chronically absent means that they miss at least 15 days of school in a year. Chronic absences affects student achievement, as well as student attitude and behavior at school. An increase in absences increases the risk of dropping out of school.
  - High-school graduation rates by race: a less specific yet helpful indicator of general educational performance outcome of students by race
- Population distribution across race in the four states: a basic description of racial divergence in the states, might differ in terms of their impacts on racial disparities

## Data Analysis
We decided to do a three-cluster analysis for each state using high school graduation rate, average SAT test score, average AP test score, and percentage of chronically absent students by race (7 races). We used these variables as we could access them across states, CB data is consistent, and because they are common indicators of educational performance across the board.
